# Pattern

So we got this main.py file as well as nc connection to the binary itself, if we connect to the binary we have two choices.

Basically, we multiple the first pattern as many times, but clearly this wont get us far, so letâ€™s analyze main.py.

There is an interesting part of the code here and that is the python format string, I believe that we can manipulate the message class to retrieve the flag via this functionality. What helped me to better understand how I can exploit Python format string functionality is the following article:

<br>
So the payload that we need to construct in order to retrieve the flag is the following: 
<br><br>
{message.__str__.__globals__[FLAG]}
<br><br>
Message part is the Message Class, __str__ as well as __globals__ to access global variables and retrieve the flag. And Voila! We got it!
